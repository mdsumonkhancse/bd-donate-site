            <h1>your donation</h1>
            <p>People depend on the natural world—its forests, fisheries and wildlife—for their ways of life. Conserving
                species, protecting habitats, and keeping our climate and environment healthy is good for all of us.
                <br>
                WWF's commitment to conservation means working in some of the most challenging places on Earth. Places
                where the protection of nature and its benefits for people can be an anchor for stability and
                opportunity. <br>
                WWF has long understood that the people who live in the places we work are critical leaders in
                conservation. Over time, our work with people has supported community efforts and led to transformative
                social and environmental results. This is a socially inclusive conservation approach. Together, we find
                practical and beneficial ways for both people and nature to thrive.
